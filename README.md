             > Rediff.com- @https://www.rediff.com/
             > livemint- @https://www.livemint.com/
             > Screener.in - @https://www.screener.in/
      
   From these are the very webistes for the use.
   **To do scrapping following libraries have been used:

                              >pip install beautifulsoup4
